   - Connection Component: Visual representation of connections between nodes
   - Node Palette: Library of available nodes
   - Properties Panel: Configuration UI for selected nodes

2. **Data Flow**
   - Unidirectional data flow between nodes
   - Type-safe connections with validation
   - Reactive updates for real-time visualization

3. **State Management**
   - Use dedicated store for workflow state
   - Separate workflow definition from execution state
   - Optimize rendering with memoization

### Integration Points

1. **Canvas Integration**
   - Extend the existing Canvas component
   - Use same zoom/pan/selection mechanics
   - Share the coordinate system with notes

2. **Note System Integration**
   - Create nodes that can interact with notes
   - Allow workflows to be triggered from notes
   - Enable workflows to create/modify notes

3. **Task Management Integration**
   - Nodes for creating and managing tasks
   - Task status changes can trigger workflows
   - Workflow execution can update task status

   interface Node {
     id: string;
     type: string;
     module: string;
     position: { x: number; y: number };
     data: Record<string, any>;
     ports: {
       inputs: Port[];
       outputs: Port[];
     };
   }

   interface Port {
     id: string;
     type: string;
     label: string;
     dataType: string;
   }
