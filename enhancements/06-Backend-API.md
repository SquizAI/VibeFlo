# Backend Enhancements: API System

## Overview

Develop a robust, scalable, and secure API system that supports all client functionality while providing clean separation of concerns, comprehensive documentation, and developer-friendly interfaces.

## API System Enhancements

### 1. RESTful API Architecture

- [ ] Create a comprehensive RESTful API with consistent patterns
  - [ ] Implement standard resource-based endpoints
  - [ ] Use consistent URL patterns and naming conventions
  - [ ] Apply proper HTTP methods and status codes
- [ ] Add versioning system for API endpoints
- [ ] Implement pagination, filtering, and sorting
- [ ] Create comprehensive validation for all API inputs
- [ ] Implement robust error handling with descriptive messages
- [ ] Add rate limiting and throttling

### 2. GraphQL Integration

- [ ] Implement GraphQL API alongside REST
  - [ ] Create schema for all data types
  - [ ] Define queries, mutations, and subscriptions
  - [ ] Implement resolvers with proper data fetching
- [ ] Add query complexity analysis and limitations
- [ ] Implement data loaders for efficient resolution
- [ ] Create persisted queries for common operations
- [ ] Build GraphQL playground with documentation
- [ ] Add type generation for client-side code

### 3. Real-time Capabilities

- [ ] Implement WebSocket support for real-time updates
  - [ ] Create event-based subscriptions system
  - [ ] Handle reconnection and message queuing
  - [ ] Implement room-based subscriptions for collaborative features
- [ ] Add server-sent events (SSE) as fallback
- [ ] Implement optimistic updates on client with server reconciliation
- [ ] Create conflict resolution strategies
- [ ] Add presence indicators for collaborative features
- [ ] Implement operational transform for collaborative editing

### 4. API Documentation and Developer Experience

- [ ] Create automatic API documentation
  - [ ] Implement OpenAPI/Swagger integration
  - [ ] Add interactive API playground
  - [ ] Generate SDK for client-side consumption
- [ ] Build comprehensive examples and tutorials
- [ ] Implement sandbox environment for testing
- [ ] Create developer portal with authentication
- [ ] Add logging and debugging tools
- [ ] Implement performance metrics and insights

### 5. API Security and Governance

- [ ] Implement robust authentication system
  - [ ] Support for multiple auth methods (token, OAuth, API key)
  - [ ] Implement role-based authorization
  - [ ] Add fine-grained permission controls
- [ ] Create audit logging for all API access
- [ ] Implement security headers and CORS configuration
- [ ] Add API usage analytics and quotas
- [ ] Create automated security scanning and testing
- [ ] Implement API key rotation and revocation system

## Tasks

- [ ] Design the API architecture and standards document
- [ ] Implement core RESTful API infrastructure
- [ ] Create GraphQL schema and resolvers
- [ ] Build the real-time capabilities infrastructure
- [ ] Develop the documentation and developer experience systems

## Technical Considerations

- Implement API gateway for centralized request handling
- Use middleware architecture for cross-cutting concerns
- Create separate service layer from controllers
- Implement circuit breakers for resilience
- Design idempotent endpoints for reliable operations
