# Project Manager Enhancement Roadmap

## Overview

This directory contains a comprehensive set of enhancement proposals for the Project Manager application, organized by functional area. Each Markdown file describes a major area of enhancement with detailed tasks and technical considerations.

## Project Structure Standards

The enhancement files follow a consistent structure:

- **Overview**: Brief description of the enhancement area
- **Specific Enhancements**: Detailed breakdown of features and capabilities
- **Tasks**: Concrete implementation items
- **Technical Considerations**: Architecture and implementation guidelines

## Implementation Priority

The roadmap is designed to be modular, allowing for parallel implementation of different enhancement areas. However, some dependencies exist between areas, and a suggested order of priority would be:

1. Project Structure and Core Architecture (foundation for all other changes)
2. Database and API Enhancements (backend infrastructure)
3. Note System and Task Management (core functionality)
4. Authentication and Sync Capabilities (multi-user support)
5. Performance and Accessibility (quality improvements)
6. Integrations and Extensions (ecosystem growth)

## Contributing to Enhancements

When implementing these enhancements:

1. Create a feature branch for each major enhancement area
2. Break down the work into manageable PRs
3. Ensure comprehensive test coverage
4. Update documentation as features are implemented
5. Validate against accessibility and performance requirements

## Tracking Progress

Track implementation progress by:

1. Converting Markdown tasks to issues in the project tracker
2. Linking PRs to enhancement areas and issues
3. Updating the enhancement files with implementation details and decisions
4. Regular review of roadmap priorities based on user feedback
