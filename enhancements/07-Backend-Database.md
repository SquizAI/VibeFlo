# Backend Enhancements: Database System

## Overview

Design and implement a robust, scalable database architecture that efficiently handles the complex data structures and relationships required for notes, tasks, and collaborative features.

## Database System Enhancements

### 1. Data Model Design

- [ ] Create comprehensive data models for all entities
  - [ ] User profiles with preferences and settings
  - [ ] Note structure with support for rich content types
  - [ ] Task system with metadata and relationships
  - [ ] Workspace organization with hierarchical structure
  - [ ] Tagging and categorization systems
- [ ] Implement efficient relationship modeling
- [ ] Design proper indexes for query patterns
- [ ] Create data validation constraints
- [ ] Implement audit/history tracking
- [ ] Design efficient storage for binary assets (images, attachments)

### 2. Query Optimization

- [ ] Implement query optimization strategies
  - [ ] Create optimized indexes for common query patterns
  - [ ] Use materialized views for complex aggregations
  - [ ] Implement query caching with invalidation
  - [ ] Design efficient paging mechanisms
- [ ] Create query monitoring and analysis tools
- [ ] Implement query plan optimization
- [ ] Design efficient full-text search indexing
- [ ] Create performance benchmarks and testing
- [ ] Implement query optimization suggestions

### 3. Scalability and Performance

- [ ] Design horizontal scaling capabilities
  - [ ] Implement database sharding strategies
  - [ ] Create read replicas for query distribution
  - [ ] Design efficient connection pooling
  - [ ] Implement cache layers (Redis, Memcached)
- [ ] Create database migration strategies
- [ ] Implement efficient batch operations
- [ ] Design backup and recovery processes
- [ ] Create monitoring and alerting systems
- [ ] Implement automated scaling based on load

### 4. Multi-tenancy and Isolation

- [ ] Implement multi-tenant database architecture
  - [ ] Create tenant isolation strategies
  - [ ] Design efficient tenant-aware queries
  - [ ] Implement resource allocation per tenant
  - [ ] Create tenant provisioning workflows
- [ ] Design cross-tenant operation safeguards
- [ ] Implement tenant migration capabilities
- [ ] Create tenant-specific backup strategies
- [ ] Design tenant analytics and usage metrics
- [ ] Implement tenant-level service tiers

### 5. Data Sync and Versioning

- [ ] Create robust data versioning system
  - [ ] Implement optimistic concurrency control
  - [ ] Design conflict resolution strategies
  - [ ] Create version history with diffing capabilities
  - [ ] Implement point-in-time recovery
- [ ] Design efficient change tracking
- [ ] Implement event sourcing for critical data
- [ ] Create offline-first sync strategies
- [ ] Design delta-based synchronization
- [ ] Implement data integrity verification

## Tasks

- [ ] Design the comprehensive data model documentation
- [ ] Implement the initial database schema with constraints
- [ ] Create migration framework for schema evolution
- [ ] Develop query optimization guidelines and tools
- [ ] Build multi-tenant infrastructure and isolation

## Technical Considerations

- Consider hybrid storage approach (SQL + NoSQL) for different data types
- Use database-level triggers sparingly to prevent performance issues
- Implement connection pooling and query timeout strategies
- Consider time-series data optimization for analytics
- Design with cloud-native architecture in mind for elasticity
