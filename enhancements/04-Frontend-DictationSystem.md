# Frontend Enhancements: Dictation System

## Overview

Enhance the dictation system to provide a seamless speech-to-text experience with intelligent processing, structured output, and feedback mechanisms.

## Dictation System Enhancements

### 1. Advanced Speech Recognition

- [ ] Implement a more accurate speech recognition engine
  - [ ] Support for technical terminology and jargon
  - [ ] User-specific vocabulary learning
  - [ ] Domain-specific language models (legal, medical, tech)
- [ ] Add multi-language support with language detection
- [ ] Create speaker identification for multi-user dictation
- [ ] Implement noise cancellation for better accuracy
- [ ] Add punctuation prediction for natural text flow
- [ ] Create custom command recognition for application control

### 2. Intelligent Dictation Processing

- [ ] Enhance automatic task detection in speech
- [ ] Implement smart formatting of dictated content
  - [ ] Auto-detect lists, headings, and paragraphs
  - [ ] Format dates, times, and numbers intelligently
  - [ ] Recognize and format code snippets
- [ ] Add automatic categorization of dictated content
- [ ] Create entity recognition for people, places, organizations
- [ ] Implement action item extraction with reminder creation
- [ ] Add meeting summarization for dictated conversations

### 3. Dictation Experience Improvements

- [ ] Create a dedicated dictation mode with fullscreen interface
- [ ] Add real-time visualization of speech recognition confidence
- [ ] Implement hands-free dictation control via voice commands
- [ ] Create a correction interface for quick text edits
- [ ] Add dictation playback for review
- [ ] Implement voice profile settings for personalization
- [ ] Create keyboard shortcuts for dictation control

### 4. Structured Output Generation

- [ ] Create templates for common dictation scenarios
  - [ ] Meeting notes with automatic attendee detection
  - [ ] Project updates with progress tracking
  - [ ] Decision records with pro/con extraction
- [ ] Implement AI-based formatting and organization
- [ ] Add automatic section creation based on content
- [ ] Create smart linking to related notes during dictation
- [ ] Implement multi-note generation from single dictation

### 5. Offline and Privacy Features

- [ ] Add offline speech recognition capabilities
- [ ] Create privacy-focused processing options
- [ ] Implement local-only mode for sensitive information
- [ ] Add encryption for dictated content
- [ ] Create data retention policies for audio recordings
- [ ] Add anonymization options for shared dictation

## Tasks

- [ ] Research and select appropriate speech recognition engine
- [ ] Design the dictation UI/UX for all states
- [ ] Implement natural language processing for intelligent features
- [ ] Create the structured output generation system
- [ ] Develop privacy and security features

## Technical Considerations

- Use WebSpeech API with fallback to custom implementations
- Implement streaming transcription for real-time feedback
- Consider edge computing for privacy-sensitive processing
- Create adaptive processing based on device capabilities
- Ensure dictation history is properly versioned
