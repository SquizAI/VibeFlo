# System Enhancements: Accessibility Features

## Overview

Implement comprehensive accessibility features to ensure the application is usable and effective for all users, regardless of abilities or disabilities, while meeting or exceeding WCAG standards and accessibility best practices.

## Accessibility Enhancements

### 1. Keyboard Navigation and Focus Management

- [ ] Implement complete keyboard navigation
  - [ ] Create logical tab order across the application
  - [ ] Implement keyboard shortcuts for common actions
  - [ ] Design visible focus indicators for all interactive elements
  - [ ] Create skip links for navigation
- [ ] Implement proper focus management
- [ ] Add keyboard shortcuts documentation
- [ ] Create custom keyboard controls for canvas interaction
- [ ] Design focus trapping for modals and dialogs
- [ ] Implement arrow key navigation for complex components

### 2. Screen Reader and Assistive Technology Support

- [ ] Ensure proper semantic markup throughout
  - [ ] Use appropriate ARIA attributes and roles
  - [ ] Implement proper heading structure
  - [ ] Create accessible form labels and descriptions
  - [ ] Design accessible error messages
- [ ] Add descriptive alt text for images
- [ ] Implement status announcements for dynamic content
- [ ] Create screen reader instructions for complex interactions
- [ ] Design accessible drag and drop alternatives
- [ ] Implement accessible canvas interactions

### 3. Visual and Design Accessibility

- [ ] Implement high-contrast mode
  - [ ] Create alternative color schemes
  - [ ] Design focus styles for high-contrast
  - [ ] Implement user preference detection
  - [ ] Create theme switching mechanism
- [ ] Add text zoom and resizing support
- [ ] Implement reduced motion mode
- [ ] Design consistent navigation patterns
- [ ] Create accessible color palette with sufficient contrast
- [ ] Implement light/dark mode with proper contrast

### 4. Cognitive and Learning Accessibility

  - [ ] Create CI/CD pipeline for accessibility checks
  - [ ] Design visual regression testing for accessibility
  - [ ] Implement screen reader testing
- [ ] Design manual testing protocols
- [ ] Create accessibility documentation
- [ ] Implement user testing with disabled users
- [ ] Design accessibility statement and compliance roadmap
- [ ] Create remediation process for issues

## Tasks

- [ ] Conduct comprehensive accessibility audit
- [ ] Implement core keyboard navigation and focus management
- [ ] Create screen reader and assistive technology support
- [ ] Develop visual and design accessibility features
- [ ] Build accessibility testing infrastructure

## Technical Considerations

- Follow WCAG 2.1 AA standards as a minimum
- Implement accessibility as part of the core development process
- Create reusable accessibility components and patterns
- Test with actual assistive technologies
- Design with accessibility in mind from the beginning
