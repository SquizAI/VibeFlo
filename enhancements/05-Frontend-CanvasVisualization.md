# Frontend Enhancements: Canvas Visualization

## Overview

Transform the canvas into a powerful visualization and organization system with spatial layouts, dynamic views, and advanced interaction features.

## Canvas Visualization Enhancements

### 1. Advanced Spatial Organization

- [ ] Implement canvas spaces/regions with borders and labels
- [ ] Create automatic layout algorithms
  - [ ] Grid layout with configurable spacing
  - [ ] Radial layout for related notes
  - [ ] Flow chart layout for sequential notes
  - [ ] Mind map layout for hierarchical notes
- [ ] Add zoom levels with level-of-detail rendering
- [ ] Create smart grouping of related notes
- [ ] Implement automatic spacing and distribution
- [ ] Add canvas templates for common layouts

### 2. Visual Relationship Mapping

- [ ] Create visual connection lines between related notes
  - [ ] Directional arrows for hierarchical relationships
  - [ ] Different line styles for relationship types
  - [ ] Interactive connection creation and editing
- [ ] Implement relationship labels and annotations
- [ ] Add collapsible/expandable relationship groups
- [ ] Create visual indicators for hidden relationships
- [ ] Implement relationship filtering by type and strength
- [ ] Add minimap navigation for relationship exploration

### 3. Canvas Navigation and Organization

- [ ] Add infinite canvas with efficient rendering
- [ ] Create canvas bookmarks for quick navigation
- [ ] Implement saved views for different perspectives
- [ ] Add canvas search with visual highlighting
- [ ] Create canvas overview mode with zoomed-out view
- [ ] Implement hierarchical canvas sections
- [ ] Add canvas history with undo/redo of spatial changes

### 4. Interactive Visualizations

- [ ] Create interactive data visualizations from note content
  - [ ] Timeline views for chronological notes
  - [ ] Kanban views for task-based notes
  - [ ] Chart generation from tabular data
  - [ ] Network graphs for relationship exploration
- [ ] Implement real-time updating visualizations
- [ ] Add interactive filtering and sorting of visualizations
- [ ] Create presentation mode for canvas content
- [ ] Implement annotation tools for visualizations

### 5. Collaborative Canvas Features

- [ ] Add multi-user canvas editing
- [ ] Create user presence indicators
- [ ] Implement canvas chat and commenting
- [ ] Add canvas change history with user attribution
- [ ] Create canvas section permissions
- [ ] Implement presentation controls for collaborative viewing
- [ ] Add canvas sharing and publishing options

## Tasks

- [ ] Design the spatial organization system
- [ ] Implement the relationship visualization components
- [ ] Create the navigation and organization features
- [ ] Develop the interactive visualization system
- [ ] Build the collaborative canvas infrastructure

## Technical Considerations

- Use WebGL for high-performance canvas rendering
- Implement spatial indexing for efficient note lookup
- Create a layered architecture for canvas elements
- Use vector graphics for scalable visualizations
- Implement efficient rendering with virtualization for large canvases
