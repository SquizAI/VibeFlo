# Frontend Enhancements: UI Components

## Overview

Upgrade the UI component system to improve aesthetics, usability, and customization while maintaining a consistent design language across the application.

## Component Library Enhancements

### 1. Comprehensive Component Design System

- [ ] Define a comprehensive design token system (spacing, colors, typography, etc.)
- [ ] Create a component playground for visual testing
- [ ] Implement theme customization (dark mode, light mode, custom themes)
- [ ] Create documentation for each component with usage examples

### 2. Advanced Note Components

- [ ] Add rich text editing capabilities to notes
  - [ ] Support for Markdown formatting
  - [ ] Support for code blocks with syntax highlighting
  - [ ] Image embedding and resizing
- [ ] Create specialized note templates (meeting notes, project planning, etc.)
- [ ] Add version history for notes with visual diff view
- [ ] Implement note linking and backlinking

### 3. Enhanced Drag and Drop

- [ ] Improve drag performance with optimized rendering
- [ ] Add multi-select for group operations
- [ ] Create snap-to guides for precise alignment
- [ ] Add resize handles for notes
- [ ] Implement canvas regions/sections to organize content
- [ ] Add collision prevention during dragging

### 4. Improved Task Management

- [ ] Create a Kanban board view for tasks
- [ ] Add priority levels with visual indicators
- [ ] Implement dependency relationships between tasks
- [ ] Create Gantt chart visualization for tasks with dates
- [ ] Add batch operations for tasks (move, tag, assign)

### 5. Search and Filtering

- [ ] Implement advanced search with filtering options
- [ ] Create saved searches feature
- [ ] Add search highlighting in results
- [ ] Implement fuzzy search for better matching
- [ ] Add recently searched terms history

## Implementation Priority

1. Design token system and basic component upgrades
2. Enhanced drag and drop functionality
3. Rich text editing capabilities
4. Task management enhancements
5. Advanced search features

## Technical Approach

- Use CSS custom properties for the design token system
- Implement virtualized rendering for large numbers of notes
- Use the Command pattern for rich text editing operations
- Utilize React context for theme management
- Build a component documentation system with Storybook
