# Backend Enhancements: Authentication & Authorization

## Overview

Implement a comprehensive, secure, and user-friendly authentication and authorization system that supports multiple identity providers while maintaining strict security standards and granular permission controls.

## Authentication & Authorization Enhancements

### 1. Multi-Provider Authentication

- [ ] Implement multiple authentication providers
  - [ ] Username/password with strong security
  - [ ] OAuth integration (Google, Microsoft, GitHub)
  - [ ] SAML for enterprise SSO
  - [ ] Social login options (Twitter, Facebook)
- [ ] Create unified user identity across providers
- [ ] Implement account linking between providers
- [ ] Add session management with expiration
- [ ] Create secure token-based authentication
- [ ] Implement biometric authentication for mobile

### 2. Advanced Security Features

- [ ] Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA)
  - [ ] Time-based one-time passwords (TOTP)
  - [ ] SMS verification codes
  - [ ] Push notifications to authenticated devices
  - [ ] Hardware security key support (U2F/FIDO2)
- [ ] Create brute force protection with rate limiting
- [ ] Implement password strength policies
- [ ] Add login anomaly detection
- [ ] Create secure account recovery flows
- [ ] Implement session hijacking protection

### 3. Authorization and Permission System

- [ ] Create role-based access control (RBAC)
  - [ ] Define core system roles (admin, user, viewer)
  - [ ] Implement custom role creation
  - [ ] Create hierarchical role inheritance
  - [ ] Add role assignment for users and groups
- [ ] Implement attribute-based access control (ABAC)
- [ ] Create resource-level permissions
- [ ] Design content-based authorization
- [ ] Implement temporary permission grants
- [ ] Add delegation capabilities for permissions

### 4. Enterprise Features

- [ ] Implement organization management
  - [ ] Create hierarchical team structures
  - [ ] Design cross-team permissions
  - [ ] Implement organization-level settings
  - [ ] Add user provisioning and deprovisioning
- [ ] Create SCIM integration for user management
- [ ] Implement LDAP/Active Directory integration
- [ ] Add audit logging for all authentication events
- [ ] Create compliance reporting for access
- [ ] Implement IP-based access restrictions

### 5. User Management and Self-Service

- [ ] Create comprehensive user profile management
  - [ ] Self-service profile editing
  - [ ] Privacy controls for sharing information
  - [ ] Account deletion and data export
  - [ ] User preferences synchronization
- [ ] Implement progressive profiling
- [ ] Add user presence and status indicators
- [ ] Create account health scoring
- [ ] Implement user feedback mechanisms
- [ ] Add account usage analytics for users

## Tasks

- [ ] Design the authentication architecture diagram
- [ ] Implement core authentication providers integration
- [ ] Create the authorization system and permission model
- [ ] Develop enterprise features for organizational use
- [ ] Build user self-service capabilities

## Technical Considerations

- Use JWT with proper signing for stateless authentication
- Implement secure password storage with modern hashing
- Use anti-CSRF tokens for form submissions
- Create clear separation between authentication and authorization logic
- Design for horizontal scaling of authentication services
