# System Enhancements: Security Features

## Overview

Implement a comprehensive security architecture that protects user data, prevents unauthorized access, ensures regulatory compliance, and builds trust through transparent security practices.

## Security Feature Enhancements

### 1. Authentication and Authorization

- [ ] Enhance authentication security
  - [ ] Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA)
  - [ ] Create adaptive authentication based on risk
  - [ ] Design biometric authentication for mobile
  - [ ] Add hardware security key support
- [ ] Create fine-grained authorization system
- [ ] Implement session management with security focus
- [ ] Design secure account recovery processes
- [ ] Add login anomaly detection
- [ ] Implement secure credential storage

### 2. Data Protection and Privacy

- [ ] Implement end-to-end encryption for sensitive data
  - [ ] Create zero-knowledge architecture
  - [ ] Design secure key management
  - [ ] Implement data categorization for protection levels
  - [ ] Add secure sharing mechanisms
- [ ] Create data minimization strategies
- [ ] Implement proper data retention and deletion
- [ ] Design privacy by default settings
- [ ] Add user consent management
- [ ] Create privacy compliance documentation

### 3. Application Security

- [ ] Implement secure development practices
  - [ ] Create security-focused code review process
  - [ ] Design secure API architecture
  - [ ] Implement input validation and sanitization
  - [ ] Add output encoding for XSS prevention
- [ ] Create content security policy

### 5. Compliance and Governance

- [ ] Implement security compliance framework
  - [ ] Create regulatory mapping (GDPR, CCPA, HIPAA)
  - [ ] Design security documentation
  - [ ] Implement audit logging for compliance
  - [ ] Add security risk assessment process
- [ ] Create vendor security assessment
- [ ] Implement data protection impact assessment
- [ ] Design security awareness training
- [ ] Add security governance structure
- [ ] Create transparent security reporting

## Tasks

- [ ] Conduct comprehensive security assessment
- [ ] Implement core authentication and authorization enhancements
- [ ] Create data protection architecture and implementation
- [ ] Develop application security features and practices
- [ ] Build compliance and governance framework

## Technical Considerations

- Implement defense in depth with multiple security layers
- Create secure defaults for all features and settings
- Design with threat modeling as a core practice
- Implement least privilege principle throughout the system
- Create security architecture documentation with clear rationale
