## Next Steps

### Immediate Fixes Needed:
1. **Add Valid API Keys** - Replace placeholder values in `.env.local` with actual API keys:
   - OpenAI API Key from https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys
   - Deepgram API Key from https://console.deepgram.com/
   - Google AI API Key from https://ai.google.dev/

2. **Fix Module Import Issues** in Note Component:
   - The component files exist but linter errors suggest path issues
   - May need to check tsconfig.json for proper path resolution

3. **Fix UI Positioning Issues**:
   - Color picker positioning
   - Task list display in various note types

### For Deployment:
1. **GitHub Setup**:
   ```bash
   cd /Users/mattysquarzoni/PRJCT_MGR\ copy\ 2
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit"
   git branch -M main
   git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/project-manager.git
   git push -u origin main
   ```

2. **Netlify Setup**:
   - Create a new site on Netlify (https://app.netlify.com/start)
   - Connect to your GitHub repository
   - Add the following environment variables in Netlify settings:
     - VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY
     - VITE_DEEPGRAM_API_KEY
     - VITE_GOOGLE_AI_API_KEY
